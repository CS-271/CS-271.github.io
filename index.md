### Course Description
This course covers advanced topics in data visualization. Over the course of the semester, we will examine seminal works and recent state-of-the-art research in information visualization, scientific visualization and visual analytics. Students are encouraged to bring in ongoing or related research. Topics covered in this class include: interaction, storytelling, evaluation, color, volume rendering, vector field visualization, visualization in sciences, big data visualization, uncertainty visualization, and visualization for machine learning.
Students will work on a semester-long visualization project that will allow them to visualize their own data sets. We will take a structured approach on how to read, analyze, present, and discuss research topics. Furthermore, we will employ peer-feedback and formal design critiques to analyze each other's work.


### Learning Outcomes

After completion of the course you will be able to:

- Read, understand, and disseminate current visualization research in the context of prior research in visualization
- Analyze, discuss, and present visualization research papers to a computer science/engineering audience
- Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
- Create a stand-alone visualization project, building on previous work and insights gained in visualization research over the last decades
- Write a short research paper about your own visualization project

### Course Structure
Classes will meet twice a week for in-class discussion of assigned reading, group-based work (e.g., design critiques), and project feedback. Students will take turns presenting papers and leading class discussion. 
Active participation and preparation for class is expected and will contribute to your final grade.
Each student is expected to work on a semester-long visualization project that will be defined within the first two weeks of class. Students will disseminate the results of their semester project in a short visualization research paper.

### Course Policies
**Attendance is mandatory!** If you have to miss a class meeting, you have to let the instructor know in advance. You are allowed two excused absences per semester; thereafter you will not receive credit for the attended class. To receive credit for attendance, you must arrive on time.  
**Active participation is expected!** Active participation and preparation for class are expected and will contribute to your final grade.  
**No open laptops!** We only allow device usage during activities that require devices. At all other times, you should not be using your device.

### Grading
Your course grade will be based on your semester project (30%), visualization paper (20%) and preparation for and participation in class (50%). This includes class participation, teamwork, adherence to deadlines, collaboration acknowledgements, timely arrival to your class, etc.

### Academic Integrity
We expect you to adhere to the [Harvard Honor Code](http://honor.fas.harvard.edu/honor-code) at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board.

You may discuss your project and homework with other people, but you are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. 
You may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers. 


### Diversity and Inclusion
I will work to create a learning environment in our class that is inclusive and respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, culture, etc. 
I ask that you engage in discussion with care and empathy for the other members in the classroom. Aim to disagree without becoming disagreeable. If something was said in class that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. 


### Accommodations for students with disabilities
Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the Accessible Education Office (AEO) and speak with the professor by the end of the second week of the term. Failure to do so may result in the instructorâ€™s inability to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential, although Faculty are invited to contact AEO to discuss appropriate implementation
